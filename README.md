Instagram-Printer-RP
==============================

Create your own Instagram printer with a Raspberry Pi, Polaroid Pogo and web server.

Notes
-----

This code is designed for use with a Raspberry Pi and Polaroid Pogo and may, or may not work with a Polaroid GL10 and other hardware

Installation & Setup
--------------------

Install Git + clone the repository;

    sudo apt-get install git-core
    git cloneÂ git://github.com/jonathanlking/Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer.git
    
Optional: You can then get the Pi to automatically update to the latest version on startup by adding this code to "/etc/rc.local"

    git pull home/username/...locationOfParentDirectory.../Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer

Install the following packages;

    sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez bluez-utils ussp-push python-bluetooth
    
Make sure you have a bluetooth adaptor connected and the Polaroid Pogo is on    

Now run the setup.py script - You must run as sudo as it needs to create files in the root directory

    cd Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer
    sudo python setup.py
    
Printing
--------

To print once setup use the following code;

    python print.py instagramLink
    
For example `python print.py http://instagram.com/p/Y-6a52hOmG/`
