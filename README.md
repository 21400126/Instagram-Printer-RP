Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer
==============================

Create your own Instagram printer with a Raspberry Pi, Polaroid Pogo and web server.

Download the files using;

    sudo apt-get install git-core
    git cloneÂ git://github.com/jonathanlking/Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer.git
    
You can then get the Pi to automatically update to the latest committed files on startup by adding

    git pull home/username/...locationOfParentDirectory.../Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer

to /etc/rc.local


Setup the Raspberry Pi using;

    sudo sh Raspberry-Pi-Instagram-Printer/init.sh

To print once setup - you get given the printer address in the setup

    sh print.sh instagramLink printerAddress
    (e.g) sh print.sh http://instagram.com/p/Y-6a52hOmG/ 00:04:48:1B:87:7F
